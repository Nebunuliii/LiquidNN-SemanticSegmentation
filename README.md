This project explores the use of Liquid Neural Networks for semantic segmentation tasks on real or synthetic images.

### Features:
- Liquid Neural Network (LNN) model implemented in Python using PyTorch
- Pixel-wise semantic segmentation on images using labeled datasets
- Evaluation with standard metrics: IoU, Dice Score, Pixel Accuracy
- Performance comparison with classic CNN architectures
